# Protein folding algorithm

Course: Algorithms and Heuristics  
Case: Protein Pow(d)er  
Team: The Folding Brigade  

## Order of business
1. main loads in csv
2. stores string of protein in Protein class
3. inputs Protein in Folder class
4. if a valid fold is made, store score and coordinates in Fold class
5. repeat until X number of valid folds is made
6. call Score to determine best Fold
7. save best fold to output
